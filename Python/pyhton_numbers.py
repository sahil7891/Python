#There are three numeric types in Python: // Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

print(type(x))  #To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:
print(type(y))
print(type(z))


x = 35e3 #Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
