#Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
#A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
#As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
#Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:


#Create and print a dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)


#Print the "brand" value of the dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])


#Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)


#Print the number of items in the dictionary:
print(len(thisdict))


#String, int, boolean, and list data types:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}


#Print the data type of a dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(type(thisdict))



#Using the dict() method to make a dictionary:

thisdict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway")
print(thisdict)

#**************************Python - Change Dictionary Items***************************


#Change the "year" to 2018:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["year"] = 2018

#**********************Python - Add Dictionary Items*******************************


#Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["color"] = "red"

  "year": 1964
}

#**************************Python - Remove Dictionary Items***************************

#The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)


#The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)


#The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)


#The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict
print(thisdict) #this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists.


#The clear() method empties the dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)


#************************Python - Loop Dictionaries*****************************

#Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict:
  print(x)


#Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])


#You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:
for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)


#You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:
for x in thisdict.keys():
  print(x)


#Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:
for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)


#************************Python - Copy Dictionaries*****************************

#Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)


#Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

#*************************Python - Nested Dictionaries****************************

#A dictionary can contain dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries.
#Create a dictionary that contain three dictionaries:
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}


#Create three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:
child1 = {
  "name" : "Emil",
  "year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
  "name" : "Tobias",
  "year" : 2007
}
child3 = {
  "name" : "Linus",
  "year" : 2011
}

myfamily = {
  "child1" : child1,
  "child2" : child2,
  "child3" : child3
}


#Print the name of child 2:
print(myfamily["child2"]["name"])


#Loop through the keys and values of all nested dictionaries:
for x, obj in myfamily.items():
  print(x)

  for y in obj:
    print(y + ':', obj[y])
